# Unix_Project3

Goes through multiples files and detects balance  in  parenthesis,  brackets  and  curly  braces.
The code asks for the amount of files you need to input.
Then you input the files one by one and check if the files have any impbalances.
If there are any imbalances the code will tell the line and the expected character.
If there is no imbalance the code outputs "No error found", if the file inputed is not
a valid file then the code will exit and output "Please input a valid file".
The porject is very similiar to project 2.
